# 8x8Matrix-Snake-Game 
An experiment if AI can make a simple game. 

So...I'm tot that good at coding but i can goof around. 
When I saw the Waveshare 8x8 LED matrix on aliexpress I knew I had to do something with it. 
I've tried to flash WLED on it, but without any sucess. I have flashed it with platformio because I couldn't get it flashed any other way. 
But there were srill some checks for pins and pin 14 couldn't be used.

Then I have thought about what to do with it that can be coded. 
And I have came up with a accel controled snake game. 
I'm a total noob in coding and I didn't know where to begin. 
Thats why I went to AI. It weren't a smooth process but after few iterations we got there. Atleast it explained it to me. 
I'm going to learn Cpp this school year so that's exiting!
